# Bankist App üöÄ

Welcome to **Bankist**, a minimalistic, fictional online banking app built with modern JavaScript! This project demonstrates my journey and growing expertise in front-end web development as I dive deep into essential JavaScript concepts, DOM manipulation, and clean, modular coding practices.

## üìã Project Overview

The **Bankist App** is a user-friendly banking interface where users can:

- Login securely with a username and PIN.
- View their account balance, transaction history, and formatted dates.
- Transfer money between accounts.
- Request a loan.
- Sort and filter transaction history.
- Logout automatically after a set period of inactivity.

---

## üåü Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login with dynamic welcome messages that display the user's first name.
- **Transaction Management**: Users can view and manage their transactions (deposits/withdrawals), and these movements are formatted based on the account's locale and currency.
- **Money Transfers**: Implemented a transfer feature allowing users to send money between accounts with smooth UI feedback.
- **Date and Time Formatting**: Added time and date display next to account balances, formatted based on user locale using the `Intl.DateTimeFormat` API.
- **Balance Calculation**: Automated total balance calculation using the `reduce()` method.
- **Dynamic UI**: Updated UI for different account interactions such as logging in, transferring money, and viewing movements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: Structuring the app with semantic elements.
- **CSS3**: Styling the app, including the use of Flexbox for responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core of the app, handling logic, interactivity, and calculations.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Directly updating the DOM to reflect user interactions.
- **JavaScript Functions**: Implemented higher-order functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to handle array manipulations.
- **Date and Time Formatting**: Utilized `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for locale-based date and time formatting.
- **Event Listeners**: Attached events to buttons for handling user actions like login, money transfer, and others.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Concepts Learned and Applied

- **Array Methods**: Extensive use of array methods (`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, and `find()`) to manipulate account data efficiently.
- **Functions and Closures**: Modular functions that handle specific tasks, ensuring code readability and reusability.
- **Event Handling**: Implemented several event listeners to react to user inputs, button clicks, and other interactions.
- **Form Handling**: Dealing with form input values, processing data, and resetting inputs for better UX.
- **Date Manipulation**: Handling and formatting dates dynamically for each transaction, reflecting accurate timestamps.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Although not strictly an OOP project, many OOP principles like encapsulation and modular code organization are followed.

## üéØ Why I Built This

Building this app has been an exhilarating experience! It demonstrates not only my technical skills but also my passion for solving problems with code. Each feature‚Äîfrom displaying transactions to implementing user authentication‚Äîhas been carefully crafted to simulate a real-world banking interface.

As someone who loves to dive into the depths of coding, I‚Äôve used **Bankist** as an opportunity to strengthen my understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals**, especially working with arrays, manipulating the DOM, and writing clean, efficient code. My goal with this project was to blend my technical knowledge with practical implementation, which has been both challenging and rewarding.

## üí° How I Approach Web Development

I approach each project with a problem-solving mindset. My passion lies in breaking down complex problems, writing clean and modular code, and continuously improving my craft. This app not only showcases my technical ability but also reflects my commitment to **learning, growing**, and **perfecting** each aspect of development.

My approach is simple: **write code, break things, fix them, and improve**. I believe that each challenge faced in a project is an opportunity to grow, and I thrive on that.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **User Profile Page**: Add a section where users can update their profile information.
- **Advanced Sorting**: Add more sorting and filtering options for transactions.
- **Responsive Design**: Improve mobile responsiveness for smaller devices.
- **Security**: Implement more robust security measures such as password hashing and stronger authentication.
- **Backend Integration**: Plan to eventually integrate a backend system for storing data persistently.
